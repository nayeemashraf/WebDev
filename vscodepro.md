# 🔥 Tips

    💡  Create Files and Folders in one go by writing the folder and file name after clicking the New File option in the Explorer like this: folder/file.html Or folder/another/file.js

    💡  Most of the Settings or actions can be accessed within Command Palette including VSCode UI changes, Extension settings, File operations, accessing Snippets, etc.

    💡  In the main settings, use @ symbol followed by the desired keyword to filter settings by category. For example, To check which settings you have configured, use @modified filter in the Search bar in the Settings.

    💡  User modified settings are indicated with a left-border on each section in the main Settings UI.

    💡  Perform Calculation within vscode by accessing the 'Evaluate Math Expression' from the Command Palette after entering the expression in the editor. Cursor must be placed after the expression in order for it to work. Example: In this expression 75/2+3, the cursor should be placed immediately after '3' with no space/character before the cursor.

    💡  Open projects directly from the terminal by typing 'code' followed by the folder name. Or navigate to the folder first and then type 'code .'

    💡  Drag and drop the terminal into the editor to open it in a separate tab for a better view.

    💡  Add custom keyboard shortcuts either by adding the additional key bindings or override the default. We can do it from Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts or in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON).
