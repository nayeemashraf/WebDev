    <h1>HTML FORM</h1>
    <!-- Forms are used to get the user input. We use <form> element for this. A backend server-side takes the user data and processes it. The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button. If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page. Here the form data is sent to a file called backend.php, it means the server-side is in php. This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data. -->
    <form action="backend.php">

      <!-- <input> tag is a single inline self-closing tag. It is used to take the user editable data. Here "First name" is the label which tells the user what type of info is to be filled. It has many attributes like text for text, button for selection, checkbox for selecting the predefined value, or radio for predefined value selection etc. -->
      First name: <input type="text"/>

      Last name: <input type="text"/>

      <!-- Here we used the <br> tag to break them down (adding line break), which isn't recommended. Instead we should use <div> tag to block elements together for grouping which is mostly used. -->
      <br/><br/>

      <div>Subject: <input type="text"/></div>
      <br/>
      <div>City: <input type="text"/></div>
      <br/>
      <div>Date: <input type="date" name="date"/></div>
      <br/>

      <!--The 'name' attribute specifies a 'name' for an <input> element. It is used so that our backend identifies that tag and take the corresponding values for processing. Each input field must have a 'name' attribute to be submitted. If the 'name' attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all. Here our 'name' attribute is 'email' that will be identified as an email address in the backend because our input type is set as email. 'name' attribute is useful for grouping different input fields of same identity especially in case of radio button. The name attribute is also used to reference elements in a JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.-->
      Email: <input type="email" name="email"/>
      <div>
        <br/>
        Are you eligible? <input type="checkbox" name="eligibility" readonly/>

      Female

      <!-- <label> element indicates the type of input to be filled in the field. We use this to wrap the input fields within it. In the above we didn't use it with any of the input fields like First name, Email, or Gender. When the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button, checkbox or text box. Label is associated with a particular input field. -->
      
      <!-- "for" attribute tells us what input field is this label for. The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. Here we tell this is for the username then it links this label with below input field. -->
      <label for="username">Username:</label>

      <!-- id attribute is the identifier of an element. Its value should be unique and no other element on current page can have the same Id. It has many uses for example it can be used as a hook in CSS or JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with specific id. The id name is case sensitive. Also, we can link it up with a specific label tag. -->
      <input type="text" id="username"/>
      <br/><br/>
      <label for="password">Password:</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password"/>

      <!-- value attribute is used for telling the server which value is submitted. Here user selects from the given options. So, we have to provide the value to the option ourselves so that server can read this value and see what the user has selected. -->
      <p>Select your age.</p>
      <input type="radio" name="age" value="0-25" id="option-1"/>
      <label for="option-1">0-25</label>

      <!-- select tag or dropbox, is used for selecting a single option from a limited number of items available to the toggle action. Inside the select element we have to provide multiple option elements. It works as a radio button. -->

      <select name="question" id="question" onchange="">
        <option value="a2">This is a select tag.</option>

      </select>

      <label for="check">This is checked</label>
      <!-- We can use checked attribute if we want something to be checked. So, that the field is already checked. -->

      <!-- "submit" and "reset" attribute function as buttons to trigger an action.
      "submit" button submits the form to backend while "reset" resets all the fields. 
      "value" attribute is the visible text that is shown for the sumit input. -->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
      <input type="reset" name="reset" id="reset"/>
      <br/><br/>

      <!-- placeholder attribute is used to give a hint to the user for indicating what to enter in the field. It appears as a watermark in the field area. We can use the placeholder for any input field. We can place it after 'type' attribute -->

      <input type="text" name="placeholder" placeholder="this is a placeholder"/>
      <br/><br/>

      <!-- If something is mandatory we use required attribute. By adding this, it ensures the user must enter the input for that field to be able to submit the form. -->
