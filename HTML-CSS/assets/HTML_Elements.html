    <!-- favicon is a small image/icon, displayed at the start of page title in the browser tab. First, we need to save our favicon image either in root directory or in the images folder in root directory. Next, add a link element of favicon attribute in the index.html file (i.e., home page) after title element. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico". A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast. -->
