//ðŸ’¡ Returning multiple values from a function.
// Here are some common ways to return more than one value from a function in JavaScript:
// 1. Returning an Object:
// You can use an object to encapsulate multiple values and return that object from the function.
function returnMultipleValues() {
  const value1 = "Hello";
  const value2 = "World";

  return {
    prop1: value1,
    prop2: value2,
  };
}

const resultObj = returnMultipleValues();
console.log(resultObj); //ðŸ”¥ {prop1: 'Hello', prop2: 'World'}

// 2. Returning an Array:
// You can return an array containing multiple values from the function.
function returnMultipleValues() {
  const value1 = "Hello";
  const value2 = "World";

  return [value1, value2];
}

const resultArr = returnMultipleValues();
console.log(resultArr); //ðŸ”¥ ['Hello', 'World']

// 3. Using Destructuring:
// If you return an array or an object from the function, you can use destructuring to capture the individual values into separate variables.
// Using array destructuring
function returnMultipleValues() {
  const value1 = "Hello";
  const value2 = "World";

  return [value1, value2];
}

const [result1, result2] = returnMultipleValues();
console.log(result1); //ðŸ”¥ Hello
console.log(result2); //ðŸ”¥ World

// Using object destructuring
function returnMultipleValues() {
  const value1 = "Hello";
  const value2 = "World";

  return {
    prop1: value1,
    prop2: value2,
  };
}

const { prop1, prop2 } = returnMultipleValues();
console.log(prop1); //ðŸ”¥ Hello
console.log(prop2); //ðŸ”¥ World

//ðŸ’¡ Rest Parameter
// The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It allows us to handle various inputs as parameters more easily. We can use the rest parameter syntax by adding â€¦ (three dots) before the last parameter in the function definition.
// A function can only have one rest parameter, and the rest parameter must be the last parameter.
function sum(...theArgs) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const arg of theArgs) {
    total += arg;
  }
  return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //ðŸ”¥ 6

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //ðŸ”¥ 10

// Another example
function myFun(a, b, ...manyMoreArgs) {
  console.log("a", a);
  console.log("b", b);
  console.log("manyMoreArgs", manyMoreArgs);
}

myFun("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six");
//ðŸ”¥ a, one
//ðŸ”¥ b, two
//ðŸ”¥ manyMoreArgs, ["three", "four", "five", "six"]

// Invalid rest parameters examples:
// const notValid = (a, ...no, b) => console.log(a, no, b);
// const non_Valid = (x, ...y, ...z) => console.log(x, y, z);

//ðŸ’¡ Closure
//âš¡ We don't explicitly write "Closures" or "Currying" we just need to understand how things work to be able to read the code when it happens implicitly.
//  In JavaScript, all functions are naturally Closures
// Inside the first() function we declare a constant 'greet' and return the second() function.
// The second() function tries to access the 'greet' variable however, it is outside of its scope and the first() function has already completed its execution and won't run again i.e., second() function shouldn't remember the 'greet' but as we know, child functions do have access to variables declared in the parent function. So, it will have a reference to this variable.
const first = () => {
  const greet = "Hi";
  const second = () => {
    alert(greet);
  };
  return second;
};

const newFunc = first();
newFunc();

// Alternate Explanations:
// A function (parent) ran. The function executed, It's never going to execute again but it's going to remember that there are references to those variables. So, the child scope always has access to the parent scope.
// OR
// A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

//ðŸ’¡ Currying
// Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. It allows you to create specialized versions of the original function by fixing certain arguments and returning new functions.

// To create a curried function, you can use arrow functions and closures in JavaScript. Here's a basic example:
const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
// In this example, multiply is a curried function that takes the first argument a and returns another function that takes the second argument b. When the inner function is invoked with b, it multiplies a and b.

// Here multiply is directly invoked with both arguments 3 and 4. It returns the result of multiplying 3 and 4, which is 12.
console.log(multiply(3)(4)); //ðŸ”¥ 12

// Assigning multiply() with 2 as argument to multiplyBy2 variable.
const multiplyBy2 = multiply(2);

// In the second example, multiplyBy2 is a new function created by invoking multiply with the argument 2. When multiplyBy2 is called with 5, it multiplies 2 and 5, resulting in 10.
console.log(multiplyBy2(5)); //ðŸ”¥ 10

// Assigning the main function to another variable with a specific value is a common pattern used in currying. It allows you to create specialized versions of the original function by fixing certain arguments, resulting in a new function with the remaining arguments.
// Examples:
// 1. Addition function:
const addMain = (a) => (b) => a + b;

const add5 = addMain(5);

console.log(add5(3)); //ðŸ”¥ 8

// 2. Currency converter:
// Formula:  Converted Amount = Original Amount (currency to be converted) * Exchange Rate (value of other currency in comparison to converted currency)
// In this example we will find 100 usd in euros.
const convertCurrency = (exchangeRate) => (amount) => amount * exchangeRate;

const usdToEur = convertCurrency(0.93); // here we invoked the function with 0.93 as the exchange rate and assigned the that usdToEur i.e., exchangeRate has received its argument.

console.log(usdToEur(100)); //ðŸ”¥ 93

//ðŸ’¡ function composition
// Function composition is a technique in functional programming where you combine multiple functions into a single function. This can be done by passing the output (result) of one function as the input (argument) to another function.

// Here we have two functions 'square' and 'double' with their own task.
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

// Now we can combine these functions to compose a new function.
// Here 'f1' and 'f2' parameters will receive the first (square) and second (double) function as arguments.
function compose(f1, f2) {
  // Now it returns another function with 'a' parameter which will be used to receive the argument for the 'square' and 'double' function.
  return function (a) {
    // It's like writing square(double(arg)); where 'double' will be called with an argument and whatever the result will be the argument to 'square' function square(4) = 16.
    return f1(f2(a));
  };
}

// The arguments are
// we can call this directly.
compose(square, double)(2); //ðŸ”¥ 16

// we can assign this to a variable and then call it from that reference.
const squareAndDouble = compose(square, double);
squareAndDouble(2); //ðŸ”¥ 16

// We can turn the above 'compose' function into an arrow function.
const arrowCompose = (f1, f2) => (a) => f1(f2(a));

//âš¡ Avoiding Side Effects and Functional Purity.

//ðŸ’¡ Side Effects.
// Side effects are actions that happen inside of a function that we aren't aware of, like interacting with an external variable, such as changing the global variable, reassigning variables, or running a loop that isn't meant to be inside of the function.

//ðŸ’¡ Functional Purity.

// A function shouldn't affect the outside world.
// A function should do things in its own universe.
// We should always declare variables inside a function if needed.
// A function should always return something.
// A function should always do the same thing it is intended to do, irrespective of the arguments it receives or the absence of parameters.

//ðŸ’¡ Function Exercises
// 1. Creating a Roll Dice with the help of Math object.
function rollDice() {
  let Dice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1);
  return Dice;
}
const DiceResult = rollDice();
console.log(DiceResult);

// 2. Function to store a parameter in an array and return it. The arguments passed to function will be pushed to array.
function storeInArray(parameter) {
  let argArray = [];
  argArray.push(parameter);
  return argArray;
}

let result = storeInArray("hello");
console.log(result); //ðŸ”¥ ['hello']

result = storeInArray(42);
console.log(result); //ðŸ”¥ [42]

// 3. Assigning function return to a variable.
let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

processed = processArg(7); //ðŸ”¥ 2

/* 4. Stand in Line

*/
// Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.

// Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.

// The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.

function nextInLine(arr, item) {
  arr.push(item);
  return arr.shift();

// 6. simple implementation of returning true or false.
// suppose we want to check whether the image has a landscape or portrait orientation, we can determine this by comparing the width and height of the image.

  return width > height;

// 7. fizzBuzz function
// 1. check whether the input is divisible by 3, return 'Fizz'
// 2. check whether the input is divisible by 5, return 'Buzz'
// 3. check whether the input is divisible by both 3 and 5, return 'FizzBuzz'
// 4. check whether the input is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the input as it is
// 5. check whether the input is not number type, return "Not a number"
function fizzBuzz(num) {
  return typeof num !== "number"
    ? NaN
    : num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 === 0

// There are three important things to consider: the order of the conditions, the handling of non-numeric inputs, and the redundancy of the fourth condition.
// First, if the input passed isn't the number, i.e., a string, or a boolean value we don't want to check the other conditions, instead of putting this condition at the last we must place it at the beginning to avoid unnecessary checks and return the result faster. Additionally, instead of returning the string "Not a number" we should return NaN, which is what it is for.

// Second, if we implement the conditions in the given order and we pass 15 as input, we want the condition 3 i.e.,'FizzBuzz' string to be executed because 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5. However, this condition will not be reached at all because the condition 1 will check it first and execute itself instead, because 15 is also divisible by 3. To resolve this problem we need to place this condition before condition 1 and 2.

// Third, as per the condition 4, if the input is not divisible by 3 or 5 we should return back the input. We do not need a separate condition for this, as it is already covered by the other conditions. All we need to do is add a return statement.
console.log(fizzBuzz(3)); //ðŸ”¥ "Fizz"
console.log(fizzBuzz(5)); //ðŸ”¥ "Buzz"
console.log(fizzBuzz(15)); //ðŸ”¥ "FizzBuzz"
console.log(fizzBuzz("hello")); //ðŸ”¥ NaN
console.log(fizzBuzz(7)); //ðŸ”¥ 7

// Alternative

  // check if num is not a number
  if (typeof num !== "number") {
