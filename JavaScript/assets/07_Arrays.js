//ğŸ’¡ Accessing Nested Arrays.
// We can access any element by combining the dot and bracket notation in an array of objects.

// We have an array of two objects named myPlants. The first element of this array is also the first object and the second element is the second object. And then inside these objects, we have key-value pairs. The second key in both objects is 'list' and its value is an array. In this example, we want to access 'pine'. If we look closely, we are accessing an array element nested in an object in the myPlants array. As we can see, the second object, which is also the second element of the myPlants array (at index 1), contains "pine" at the second position in the "list" array property, more specifically at index [1]. We know second object is at index 1 and "pine" is at index 1 in the "list" property. So, in order to access it, we will use myPlants with bracket notation and enter 1 as the index value followed by dot notation(because we are accessing an object property) and key name 'list' with bracket notation and an index value of 1.
const myPlants = [
  {
