/* In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
*/
// if statements are used to make decisions in code. The 'if' keyword tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.
// When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

function test(myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
// This function returns the string "It was true" if we pass true or "It was false" if we pass false. If the argument passed to the function evaluates to true, the if block is executed and "It was true" is returned. If the argument evaluates to false, the if block is not executed and "It was false" is returned because that is what the function is returning. If we call the function without any arguments, "It was false" will be returned..

// voting eligibility using comparison operators...
// If else statement checks if the first condition is true or false. If it's true it will execute the codeblock underneath. Suppose in the below example if we had placed the third statement i.e., (else if (userAge >= 18)) at second place. Then assigning userAge to 91 would have returned "Please cast your Vote", which we don't want to. Here it checked if 91 is greater than 18 or not, which is true. It executed its codeblock without checking the below condition. So, Order matters in if else statements.
let userAge = 18;
if (userAge < 18) {
  console.log("Thanks for showing your interest! you're too young to vote.");
} else if (userAge >= 91) {

// If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
// If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
// The value of case can be a variable value, string, number or comparison expression.
// 'break' keyword is used to break out of the switch statement as soon as it matches the corresponding case without having to look for other cases. If we don't use this it will always throw the last case and run the code for every case below the matched case.
// 'default' acts as an else statement i.e., if we pass any unmatched value or an invalid value it will throw the default statement.
// Remember, switch statement uses strict equality i.e., it takes into consideration the type as well as the actual value.
