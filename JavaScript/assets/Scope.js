//ðŸ’¡ Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
// It is the space or environment in which a certain variable is declared.

// Scope of a variable: Region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed.

// Before ES6(2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important JavaScript keywords: let and const.

// Variables declared with 'let' and 'const' have block scope in addition to global scope. That is, when they are declared inside a block, they can only be accessed within that block. When declared outside of a block, they can be accessed anywhere in the code.

// In JavaScript, by default we are in the global scope. In web browsers, it's the window scope (global object). Variables declared in the global scope become properties of the global object.

//ðŸ’¡ Variables declared in global scope (outside of a code block {}) are known as global variables, Variables declared inside the code block are known as local variables.

//ðŸ’¡ Block Scope
// variable 'message' is only accessible within the code block.
{
  let message = "This is Block-Scoped";
  console.log(message); //ðŸ”¥ This is Block-Scoped
}

// We cannot access the 'message' variable outside of the 'start' function.
function start() {
  const message = "hello";
  console.log(message);
}
let load = message;
console.log(message);

// Same would be true for an if block.
// We are calling 'another' outside of its own block. Which isn't going to work.
function Go() {
  let message = "Hey";
  if (true) {
    const another = "bye";
  }
  console.log(another);
}

// In case of a loop.
// We now have a for loop. Here 'i' is a variable that is only accessible within its own block. It is now a local variable of that block.

    console.log(i); // 'i' has scope within this curly braces.
  }

//ðŸ’¡ It is valid to have variables with identical names in separate blocks. Since the scope of these variables is limited to the block in which they are defined hence they are distinct variables.
// We declared variables with the exact same name. Here 'same' is defined both in global scope and local scope. When we call it inside the code block, it refers to the local variable. When we call it outside the code block in global scope, it refers to the global variable. Block-scoped variables are local in their respective code blocks with local scope.

//ðŸ’¡ Global Scope
// Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. Variables defined in global scope are accessible from everywhere. Global variables are attached to the global object (in browsers, it's the window object).

const num1 = 20;

//ðŸ’¡ Shadowing
// When a variable is declared in a certain scope having the same name defined on its outer scope and when we call the variable from the inner scope, the inner variable takes precedence within its scope, and any reference to that variable within that scope refers to the inner variable rather than the outer one.
// OR
// The variable whose scope is most immediate takes precedence.
// OR
// The variable in the inner scope (block scope) "shadows" the variable in the outer scope, meaning it takes precedence within its own scope.

// Case 1.
// In each case, 'y' that is just above the execution call takes precedence over any other 'y' variable before it.
let y = 25;

// Case 2.
// Although we have already declared round1 and round2 in the global scope with values of 20 and 3, respectively, but when we call the add() function, it uses the variables declared within its parent function.
const round1 = 20;
const round2 = 3;

  const round1 = 2;
  const round2 = 3;

  }
  return add();
}

getScore(); //ðŸ”¥ "Kevin scored 5"

// Case 3.
// first console log statement is not able to access the 'x' variable defined in the global scope because the local variable 'x' shadows the global variable.
const x = "Out";

//ðŸ’¡ Global variables in JavaScript have a longer lifespan, persisting throughout the entire program execution.
// Global variables in a web page context live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or close the window, or refresh the page.

//ðŸ’¡ Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.
// Once the function completes its execution, local variables go out of scope and are "deleted" or more precisely, they become inaccessible. The memory occupied by these local variables is typically freed up, and the variables cease to exist.

//ðŸ’¡ All undeclared variables are global variables.
// If we declare a variable without the 'let' or 'const' keyword, the variable is declared as a global variable. This means that the variable is accessible from anywhere in the code, including from other functions.
//â›” Declaring variables without keywords is a bad practice. So, ignore this weird behaviour.
