//ðŸ’¡ Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
// Space or environment in which a certain variable is declared.

// Scope of a variable: Region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed.

// Before ES6(2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

// variables declared with 'let' and 'const' have block scope in addition to global scope. That is, when they are declared inside a block, they can only be accessed within that block. when declared outside of a block, they can be accessed anywhere in the code.

// In JavaScript, by default we are in the global scope. In web browsers, it's the window scope (global object). Variables declared in the global scope become properties of the global object.

//ðŸ’¡ Variables declared in global scope (outside of a code block {}) are known as global variables, Variables declared inside the code block are known as local variables.


//ðŸ’¡ Block Scope
// variable 'message' is only accessible within the code block.
{
  let message = "This is Block-Scoped";
  console.log(message); //ðŸ”¥ This is Block-Scoped

// We cannot access the 'message' variable outside of the 'start' function.

  const message = "hello";
  console.log(message);

// Same would be true for an if block.
// We are calling 'another' outside of its own block. Which isn't going to work.
function Go() {
  let message = "Hey";

    const another = "bye";
  }
  console.log(another);

Go();

// In case of a loop.
// We now have a for loop. Here 'i' is a variable that is only accessible within its own block. It is now a local variable of that block.
function Gone() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // 'i' has scope within this curly braces.
  }
  let view = i; // Not accessible here.

//ðŸ’¡ It is valid to have variables with identical names in separate blocks. We are allowed to redeclare a variable outside of a code block. Since the scope of these variables is limited to the block in which they are defined hence they are separate variables independent of each other.
// We declared variables with the same name. Here 'same' is defined both in global scope and local scope. When we call it inside the code block, it refers to the local variable. When we call it outside the code block in global scope, it refers to the global variable. Block-scoped variables are local in their respective code blocks with local scope.

// Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. Variables defined in global scope are accessible from everywhere. Global variables are attached to the global object (in browsers, it's the window object).

//* It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

// first console log statement is not able to access the 'glo' variable defined in the global scope because the local variable 'glo' shadows the global variable.

//ðŸ’¡ All undeclared variables are global variables.
// If we declare a variable without the 'let' or 'const' keyword, the variable is declared as a global variable. This means that the variable is accessible from anywhere in the code, including from other functions.
